## What is this and who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Frontend consulting is what I do! Angular and React, and this is a showcase product I made in my spare time. It is an excellent example of a modern, real-world React codebase and it integrate with the Shopify Admin, uses Shopify Polaris UI Framework, and extensions that are built into the Shopify theme.

There are numerous showcase/example React projects available, but the majority of them are far too simple. I like to think that this codebase is complex enough to provide valuable insights to React developers of all skill levels while remaining _relatively_ simple to understand.

## Booking Shopify External Application

The staff can log in and view their bookings using this application.

Heroku does not let several apps in the same repository, which is why I had to create new repos this application.

The frontend of this application uses vite/react/typescript while the backend uses node/express/typescript.
