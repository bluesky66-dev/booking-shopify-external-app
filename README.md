# Booking Shopify External Application

This application is for the staff, they can login and see their bookings.

This is continues work for [https://github.com/jamalsoueidan/booking-shopify-embed-app](https://github.com/jamalsoueidan/booking-shopify-embed-app)

The reason this is in another repostory is that heroku doesn't allow different apps in the same repo, so I had to create new one for this application.

This application consist of node/express/typescript in the backend, and vite/react/typescript in the frontend.

Let's go.
