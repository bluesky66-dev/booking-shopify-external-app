I have developed two different applications for appointment scheduling.

[The embedded application](https://github.com/jamalsoueidan/booking-shopify-embed-app) and the external application(this repo).

The supervisor uses [the embedded application](https://github.com/jamalsoueidan/booking-shopify-embed-app) in the Shopify admin to view all bookings for all staff, as well as to create new staff members and add them to various groups, etc.

This external application gives each member of staff access to their own bookings, schedule etc., allows them to edit their own bookings, schedule their time-work, and so on. Also see other members of the group bookings.

Both applications use [the booking shopify framework](https://github.com/jamalsoueidan/booking-shopify-framework) to save ourself from duplicating code.

## What is this and who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Frontend consulting is what I do! Angular and React, and this is a showcase product I made in my spare time. It is an excellent example of a modern, real-world React codebase and it integrate with the Shopify Admin, uses Shopify Polaris UI Framework, and extensions that are built into the Shopify theme.

There are numerous showcase/example React projects available, but the majority of them are far too simple. I like to think that this codebase is complex enough to provide valuable insights to React developers of all skill levels while remaining _relatively_ simple to understand.

## Booking Shopify External Application

The staff can log in and view their bookings using this application.

Heroku does not let several apps in the same repository, which is why I had to create new repos for this application.

The frontend of this application uses vite/react/typescript while the backend uses node/express/typescript.
